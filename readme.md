#Twentyeleveni
##About
Twentyeleveni (Twenty Eleven Improved) is a starter theme that extends the twentyeleven theme. It provides a basic starting point for clients such as small businesses. See my perfecting Twentyeleveni section for functionality that extends wordpress and is better handled by specialist plugins.

Basic features of Twentyeleveni include:

1. Navigation Menu(s)
1. Optional homepage slideshow gallery
1. Consistent two column layout
1. Featured image (post thumbnail) support
1. Minimal layout markup
1. Improved on native thickbox with reveal (dialogs) and slimbox2 (lightbox) scripts
1. Orbit script included for slideshows
1. No images! Placeholder images are remotely pulled from flickr, and icons are font based


###Why Twentyeleveni?

Twenty Eleven came about because the default Wordpress theme, Twenty Eleven, has some blog-centric features not relevant to the client's sites I was building and fairly obtrusive, convoluted markup:

1. Singular post lack of a sidebar
1. Complex HTML and style rules (2710 lines of style rules)
1. Complex template files with extraneous PHP code (Consider the wp_title() code yikes!)

##Perfecting Twentyeleveni

I would recommend using the following plugins to perfect your Twentyeleveni install:

1. [Yoast SEO](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/) for managing SEO related data
1. [Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/) for placing a contact form
2. [WP-PageNavi](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/) for pagination
